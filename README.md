# Harvard Systems-Theory Seminar

## Description
We are hoping to spur more fruitful collaborations between the theorists and the systems folks through Systems-Theory seminar. The seminar will be in Harvard SEC 2.330, with talks starting at 3:45 and snacks at 3:00.

## Schedule

- 09/28/2022: **Algorithms for Programmable Switches**
  * Speaker: [Minlan Yu](http://minlanyu.seas.harvard.edu/) (Harvard)
  * Abstract: Minlan Yu will be talking about her work about building algorithms and data structures into programmable switches.  But we'll also be talking about building up a community of people working at the interface of systems and theory, and how we think it can lead to great research synergies.  
  * Slides: [link](slides/theosys-22fall-1.pptx)
- 10/12/2022: **Lossy Compression schemes for Federated and Distributed Learning Systems**
  * Speaker: [Michael Mitzenmacher](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/) (Harvard)
  * Abstract: Michael Mitzenmacher will talk about his work with several others on lossy compression schemes for federated and distributed learning systems, and the corresponding distributed mean estimation problem.  In particular, we’ll look at some of the properties of random rotations on high-dimensional spheres, and why they end up being useful in this setting. He’ll also talk a bit about his thoughts on working at the intersection of systems and theory, and how both sides need to talk more with each other.

- 10/26/2022:
  * Speaker: [Alan Liu](https://zaoxing.github.io/) (Boston University)

  * Speaker: [Tim Kraska](https://people.csail.mit.edu/kraska/) (MIT)

- 12/07/2022: **CausalSim: A Causal Inference Framework for Unbiased Trace-Driven Simulation**
  * Speaker: [Muhammad Alizadeh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alizadeh/) (MIT)
  * Abstract: Trace-driven simulation is a widely used method for evaluating new ideas in systems. Today's trace-driven simulators assume that the interventions being simulated (e.g., a new algorithm or architectural choice) would not affect the validity of the traces. However, real-world traces are often biased by the environment used during trace collection, and hence replaying traces under an intervention may lead to incorrect results. This talk will present CausalSim, a causal inference framework for unbiased trace-driven simulation that addresses this challenge. CausalSim learns a causal model of the system dynamics and latent factors capturing the underlying system conditions during trace collection. It learns these models using an initial randomized control trial (RCT) under a fixed set of algorithms and uses them to remove biases from trace data when simulating new algorithms.<br />I will describe CausalSim’s key ideas, in particular, a connection between trace-driven simulation and a certain tensor completion task with extremely sparse observations. I will discuss how CasualSim exploits a basic distributional invariance property present in RCT data to solve this tensor completion problem. Finally, I will present CasualSim’s evaluation, including a real-world case study on the Puffer video streaming system in which CasualSim provides markedly different insights about adaptive bitrate (ABR) protocols compared to current biased simulators.
