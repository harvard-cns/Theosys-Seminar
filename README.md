   Title: Living on the Edge for a Quarter Century: A Personal Retrospective
  
Abstract:
As the creation of the edge turns 25, we look back at the critical role that it has played in the evolution of internet services. The story of the edge started in the late 1990s when servers were deployed worldwide at the internetâ€™s edge to provide content delivery services for web pages and videos. The quest to move dynamic content and application logic closer to users created the first edge computing services a few years later. Currently, edge services are accessed by billions of users daily, accounting for most of the users and traffic on the internet today. Close interactions between theory and practice enabled the dramatic rise of the edge over the last quarter century. Theoretical ideas became part of production systems and practice drove new theoretical formulations. In telling the story of the edge, we will emphasize a few of these interactions to highlight the role of theory in practice.

     Title: Improved Frequency Estimation Algorithms with and without Predictions 

Abstract: Estimating frequencies of elements appearing in a data stream is a key task in large-scale data analysis. Popular sketching approaches to this problem (e.g., CountMin and CountSketch) come with worst-case guarantees that probabilistically bound the error of the estimated frequencies for any possible input. The work of Hsu et al. introduced the idea of using machine learning to tailor sketching algorithms to the specific data distribution they are being run on. In particular, their learning-augmented frequency estimation algorithm uses a learned heavy-hitter oracle which predicts which elements will appear many times in the stream. We give a novel algorithm, which in some parameter regimes, already theoretically outperforms the learning based algorithm of Hsu et al. without the use of any predictions. Augmenting our algorithm with heavy-hitter predictions further reduces the error and improves upon the state of the art. Empirically, our algorithms achieve superior performance in all experiments compared to prior approaches.
